## FEATURE:

Core Architecture:

Multi-Agent System using Pydantic AI:
- Content Analysis Agent: Stores and analyzes existing content to extract topics, keywords, and semantic relationships
- SEO Research Agent: Uses SearXNG API to identify trending topics, keyword opportunities, and competitor analysis
- Content Generation Agent: Generates new content based on identified gaps and opportunities
- Graph Management Agent: Maintains and updates the knowledge graph structure in Neo4j
- Quality Assurance Agent: Ensures content aligns with brand voice and quality standards

Data Infrastructure:

- Neo4j Graph Database: Stores content relationships, topic hierarchies, and SEO metadata
-- Nodes: Topics, Articles, Keywords, Trends
-- Edges: Semantic relationships, internal links, keyword associations

- Qdrant Vector Database: Stores content embeddings for semantic search and similarity matching
- Supabase: User management, content versioning, and API authentication

Key Functionalities:

- Content Ingestion Pipeline:
-- Parse existing content (markdown, HTML, PDFs)
-- Extract topics, entities, and keywords
-- Generate embeddings and store in Qdrant
-- Build knowledge graph in Neo4j

Gap Analysis Engine:

- Compare existing content coverage against trending topics
- Identify missing subtopics and related keywords
- Prioritize opportunities based on search volume and competition

Content Generation Workflow:

- Topic selection based on gap analysis
- Option of importing briefs from google drive
- Outline generation using graph relationships
- Content drafting with brand voice consistency
- Internal linking suggestions based on graph connections

Monitoring & Analytics:

- Track content performance metrics
- Monitor keyword rankings (integration with Google Ads API)
- Visualize content graph and coverage gaps
- Langfuse for LLM observability and cost tracking

User Interfaces:

- CLI Tool: For batch operations, content ingestion, and administrative tasks
- Web Dashboard (Ag-ui/OpenWebUI):
-- Interactive graph visualization
-- Content planning calendar
-- Human-in-the-loop content review and editing
-- SEO performance dashboards

## EXAMPLES:

Examples from our examples/ folder include:
- case studies of successful SEO strategies
- examples of how topics are interlinked for SEO purpose
- Agent UI/UX examples with "Human In the Loop" function
- examples of isual knowledge graphs
- example of ahrefs seo/keyword monitoring dashboard

Donâ€™t copy any of these examples directly, it is for a different project entirely. But use this as inspiration and for best practices.

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

Technical Requirements:

Environment Setup:

- Include comprehensive .env with all required API keys and configurations
- Docker Compose setup for Neo4j, Qdrant, and Supabase local development
- Python virtual environment with dependencies managed via requirements.txt


Configuration:
